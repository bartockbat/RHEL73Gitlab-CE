# RHEL73Gitlab-CE

This is a repo for a RHEL based Docker image containing the Community Editon of Gitlab -8.13.1-ce-0.

It's not complete.
1. It builds without errors
2. It will run but doesn't really do anything (operationally)
3. It passes our certification scan as it meets all of the critera

I will have to defer to the Gitlab folks to fill in the blanks to make this container operational. 
This will get you started and pass our cert scan.
